This gives a coloured representation of the 2d heat equation approximate evolution, with wrapped boundary conditions. To start, either click within the red square or press the "Random" button. 


The default settings with random show a quick transition from chaos to formation of ordered domains.Setting the hue scaling higher(~100) and clicking on an empty grid forms images with mandala-like symmetries. Raising the carefulness makes the evolution slower.

Options:
Hue scaling - How quickly the hue changes
Saturation scaling - How quickly the saturation changes
Update period - Time(in ms) to update image. Setting this too low may cause computer to slow
Click strength - How much to change f when clicking or making a random grid
Carefulness - How quickly to change values, similar to a time step

Simulation can be paused by setting update period or carefulness to a high value
